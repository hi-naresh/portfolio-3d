# Web portfolio

This is a web portfolio that I created to showcase my projects and skills. It is a static website that is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive and works on all devices.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the website [here](https://example.com).
